### View Attendance Records

1. **Go to the Records Page**:  
   Open:

   The CSV file or you can check the Excel file.

2. **Filter and Review Logs**:  
   Utilize filters by date or student name to review detailed attendance logs.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Overview

### Face Detection
- **Method:**  
  Uses OpenCV to capture video frames from the webcam and detect faces using Haar cascade classifiers.
  
### Face Recognition
- **Process:**  
  Compares detected faces with stored facial data to confirm identity.

### Attendance Logging
- **Procedure:**  
  Once recognized, the student‚Äôs attendance status is updated in the database with the corresponding timestamp, ensuring precise record-keeping.
